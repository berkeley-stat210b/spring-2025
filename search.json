Evans 387.\n\n\nGSI: Kaihao Jing (khjing [at] berkeley.edu)\n\n\nOffice Hours: TBA.\n\n\nDiscussion sessions: Every other week. Time and location TBA.\n\n\nThis is an advanced graduate course on mathematical statistics, following up on the introductory course STAT 210A. Topics to be covered include tail bounds and basic aspects of concentration of measure, uniform laws of large number, metric entropy and chaining arguments, Gaussian comparison inequalities, covariance estimation and non-asymptotic random matrix theory, sparse high-dimensional models, structured forms of principal component analysis, non-parametric regression, and minimax lower bounds.",
